  "body": "# Potluckmap: Bring Your Data to the Collaborative Map\r\n\r\n## What Can Potluckmap Do for You?\r\n\r\nPotluckmap displays your (perhaps along with others')\r\ngeographic data in OpenStreetMap.\r\nIt is written in javascript and has\r\nseveral interesting features:\r\n1. You can specify several data sources and\r\n   it displays all of them on a single map.\r\n2. The data sources can be provided in some of the\r\n   many formats supported by\r\n   [leaflet-omnivore](https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore),\r\n   including .geojson, .gpx, .csv .\r\n   Additionally, potluckmap also accepts\r\n   the output of OverpassTurbo requests.\r\n3. Each data source can be instructed to refresh itself\r\n   at fixed time intervals. (_only partially implemented_)\r\n4. Each marker can be rotated at a different angle.\r\n   (_only partially implemented_)\r\n5. You can run potluckmap completely offline\r\n   if you have a local tile server and use only local data sources.\r\n\r\n(1) and (2) makes it suitable for collaboration among different\r\ngeographic data providers such as different government departments.\r\nEach party can focus on simply producing its own textual data.\r\nThe idea is to separate map data from presentation,\r\nanalogous to the idea of \"separation of content from presentation\"\r\nin word processing or web publishing (html + css).\r\n\r\n(3) and (4) makes it suitable for displaying moving vehicles\r\nsuch as buses, cars, and bikes. City governments all over\r\nthe planet would save a lot of map-coding efforts\r\nif they simply publish live bus information in one of\r\nthe above-mentioned text formats.\r\nTravellers would only need one public-transportation\r\napp around the world.\r\n\r\nPrivacy-conscious users and users who need to use maps offline\r\nwill find (5) particularly appealing.\r\n\r\n## Trying Out Potluckmap Online Without Installing It\r\n\r\n(To be added)\r\n\r\n## Installing Potluckmap\r\n\r\nJust download potluckmap and open potluckmap.html in firefox.\r\n\r\nChrome or chromium users who want to use local data sources\r\nhave two options. Either install a local web server and\r\naccess potluckmap.html through the web server,\r\nor start the browser from the command line:\r\n`chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files`.\r\nPlease see [javascriptCanReadLocalFiles](https://github.com/ckhung/javascriptCanReadLocalFiles) for details.\r\n\r\nPotluckmap uses a lot of libraries.\r\nIf you want to run it offline, not only do you have to have\r\na local tile server, but also you need to download all\r\nthe .js and .css files and fix the paths in potluckmap.html .\r\nHere is a command to list all the .js and .css files:\r\n`perl -ne 'print \"$1\\n\" if (m#<script.*src=\"(.*?\\.js)\"# or m#<link.*href=\"(.*?\\.css)\"#)' potluckmap.html`\r\n\r\n## Basic Setup\r\n\r\nPotluckmap does not have a fancy user interface (yet).\r\nYou have to edit its configuration file config.json manually.\r\nFor now please skip parts that look intimidating and please\r\nonly change the subfields below \"startval\" according to your need:\r\n\r\n1. \"title\": the title of your map.\r\n2. \"sources\": the data sources of your map.\r\n   You can specify the format and the URL of each source.\r\n   You can also specify what shapes and what icons to use\r\n   when displaying nodes from each source.\r\n3. \"views\": a list of frequently used views as defined\r\n   by their names, zoom levels, and geographic coordinates.\r\n\r\nMore details in later sections.\r\n\r\n## Using Potluckmap\r\n\r\nIn the bottom left corner there are a few menu buttons.\r\n\r\nThe \"pushpin\" menu button include options for you to:\r\n\r\n1. [some place name] switch to a predefined view\r\n2. [remember here] replace the current view with\r\n   what you are looking at right now\r\n\r\nThe \"reload\" menu button include options for you to:\r\n1. [reload all] reload all data sources\r\n2. [reload changed] reload those data sources\r\n   that have been manually changed in the configuration area\r\n3. [rebuild menu] rebuild the pushpin menu after you\r\n   manually add entries to, delete entries from,\r\n   or change the names of the views list in the configuration area.\r\n\r\n## Saving and Restoring Your Configuration\r\n\r\nBelow the map is the configuration area.\r\nPotluckmap uses [json-editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor)\r\nas a lazy programmer's user interface --\r\noptions that don't yet have a normal UI can be changed here.\r\nFor example, you can add views, delete views,\r\nchange the view name here.\r\nHowever, changes may not go into effect immediately.\r\nThat's why there are menu items like [reload changed]\r\nand [rebuild menu] in the map UI.\r\n\r\nAfter you have configured your sources and views,\r\nyou may want to save it.\r\nPress the [Edit JSON] button, copy the content,\r\nand (using a text editor) paste it to your new config.json file.\r\n(Note: the [save] button does not save anything to the disk.\r\nIt only confirms your manual editing within this session.)\r\nPotluckmap will then use your new configuration the next time it is run.\r\n\r\n## More Details About the Configuration Options\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs and To Do List\r\n\r\n",
